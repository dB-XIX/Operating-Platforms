# Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client is The Gaming Room and they want to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
Something I did particularly well in this exercise was the level of detail I provided in each section.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found the Domain Model and UML Diagram to be the most useful part of the design document when it came to writing the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
At this point, I would not revise any of it. I took a significant amount of time developing this document to the best of my ability.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider they user's needs when designing because they are paying for a particular product to fullfill a particular need. If it does not do that then it is useless to them. The most significant element of the user's needs in this situation was their need to expand easily and distribute to multiple platforms. I did this using Java and recommended Windows Server 2022 because of its cloud capability.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I examined and anaylized the customer's needs, developed an outline in the form of the design document, then executed that design to form an application and present an architecture that would best suit their situation. This technique, or a variation, is likely what I will use in the future to design software for customers.
